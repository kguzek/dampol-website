# Dampol Website

This is the product website for Dampol Investment sp. z o. o., which is a local container producer in Czekan√≥w, Poland. It is written in Angular and includes model previews, feature selection, price prediction, as well as a customer information form and order submission feature. Aside from this, it includes an "About" section and a "Contact" section for more information about the company and to help guide customers if further information is needed.

The model information is hosted independently on a self-hosted headless Directus CMS instance, but the website is statically rendered and rebuilt twice a day on working days fetching the data at build time. After hydration, the data is fetched on the client when stale, so the website content is always both up-to-date and statically served, levaraging the powerful tools made available by Angular and making the best of SSG and CSR.

The website is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://kguzek.github.io/dampol-website).
